## Project by: Iftekhar A Chowdhury
## Project Title: Use a Public API to Create an Employee Directory
## Project Requirements:
```
    1) Get and display 12 random users from The Random User Generator API
        a) Using photos and information that the API provides, you’ll display 12 users, along with some basic information:
            i)   Image
            ii)  First and Last Name
            iii) Email
            iv)  City
    2) Create a modal window that will pop up when any part of the user’s row is clicked. The following details should display in the modal window:
        a) Image
        b) Name
        c) Username
        d) Email
        e) Cell Number
        f) Detailed Address, including street name and number, city, country and post code.
        g) Birthdate
    3) Structure and style the user directory so that it roughly matches the provide mockup.
        a) Display the users in a grid or table
        b) Add a hover state to the rows of the user table.
        c) Make sure there’s a way to close the modal window
```
## Exceeds Expectations Requirements:
```
    1) Add a way to filter the directory by name or username. To do this, you’ll need to request a random user nationality that will only return data in the English alphabet.
       Note: you don't have to rely on the API to return search results. You'll need to write functionality that filters results once they already on the page.
    2) Add a way to move back and forth between employee detail windows when the modal window is open.
